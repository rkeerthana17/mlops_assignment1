# **MLOPS Assignment 1**

## **M2: Process and Tooling**

**Objective:** Gain hands-on experience with popular MLOps tools and understand the processes they support.

### **Tasks:**

**1. Experiment Tracking:**

   	Use MLflow to track experiments for a machine learning project.
    
	Record metrics, parameters, and results of at least three different model training runs.

**2. Data Versioning:**

   	Use DVC (Data Version Control) to version control a dataset used in your project.
    
   	Show how to revert to a previous version of the dataset.

 
### **Deliverables:**

	MLflow experiment logs with different runs and their results.
 
	A DVC repository showing different versions of the dataset.
